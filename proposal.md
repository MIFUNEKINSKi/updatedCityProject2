## Overview
Using the d3 library I would like to show at least two graphs, comparing cities “livability score” out of 100.     Maybe a bar chart comparing the cities, and then you can toggle different factors that contribute to the livability.  (Potential improvement would be a dynamic change to the weight of the different factors, and to allow the user to weight things themselves) 



API availability might be difficult, if so the baseline would be the mortality / morbidity of each city and then add more data from there.
Second part of the app (time permitting) will be on the left side of the screen a globe that you can spin around to click on the cities, rather than a dropdown box of the cities available.

## Functionality
 -  In City Livability you will be able to compare global cities on livability factors
 - Can toggle different factors and weight them based on your preference
 - add multiple cities
 - toggle different livability factors
 - weight them based on your preference
 - compelling graphs of said data
 - world map with some city information when you click on it
